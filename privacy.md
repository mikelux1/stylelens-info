# Privacy Policy

**StyleLens**

*Last updated: January 22, 2026*

## Introduction

StyleLens ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS application.

StyleLens is a photo organization app that uses on-device artificial intelligence to help you sort and curate your photos based on technical quality, aesthetic appeal, and your personal preferences.

## Information We Collect

### Information Processed Locally (On Your Device Only)

The following data is processed and stored **exclusively on your device** and is never transmitted to our servers:

**Photos and Photo Metadata**
- Your photos are accessed only when you grant permission through iOS
- Photo analysis (quality scoring, content detection) happens entirely on-device using Apple's CoreML framework
- We do not upload, transmit, or store your photos on any external server
- Photo metadata (dates, locations, albums) is used locally to help you filter and organize photos

**Learning Profile**
- Your personal preferences learned from your photo selections
- Quality preference weights (sharpness, exposure, contrast, noise, composition, color harmony, visual balance)
- Content preference embeddings (anonymous mathematical representations of your visual preferences)
- This data is stored securely in encrypted device storage

**Selection History**
- Records of which photos you've picked or unpicked during sorting sessions
- Used locally to improve personalization accuracy
- Contains photo identifiers and quality scores, not the photos themselves

**Imported Styles**
- StyleDNA profiles you import from other users via QR code or image
- Stored locally in encrypted device storage

### Information Collected Automatically

**Analytics Data (Anonymous)**

We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to improve the app experience. This includes:

- App events (e.g., onboarding completion, feature usage)
- General interaction patterns (e.g., which sorting modes are popular)
- Crash reports and performance metrics
- Device type and iOS version (for compatibility purposes)

This data is:
- Completely anonymous and not linked to any personal identifier
- Aggregated for statistical analysis
- Used solely to improve app functionality and user experience
- Processed in accordance with Google's Firebase privacy practices

**What We DO NOT Collect:**
- Your name, email, or contact information (unless you contact support)
- Your photos or photo content
- Location data from your photos
- Your contacts or other personal information

## How We Use Information

**On-Device Processing**
- To analyze photo quality and aesthetics

**Analytics Data**

## Data Storage and Security

**Local Storage**
- All personal data (learning profile, selection history, preferences) is stored in encrypted device storage
- We use iOS secure storage mechanisms (Keychain and encrypted file storage)
- Data remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it

**No Cloud Storage**
- StyleLens does not maintain user accounts
- We do not store your data on cloud servers
- Your learning profile stays on your device

**StyleDNA Sharing**
- When you share your StyleDNA, only your preference weights are exported
